# File-Scanner

This is a project I made to practice my cv2 skills. To be able to get this final product I had to undrstand and modify the images.

## Functionalities

This application, as the title says, looks for the biggest contour (zone with diferent color) and crip the image to focus it
completly and then allows the user to take a screenhsot.
